OPERATING SYSTEM: UBUNTU 20.04


***SERVER PROGRAM INSTRUCTIONS***

COMPILE: 
gcc server.c -lm -o server

RUN:
./server <filename> <PORT NUMBER>

RUN example:
./server input.txt 8080

The command line arguments are as follows:
argv[1] - <FILE NAME>
argv[2] - <PORT NUMBER>


***CLIENT PROGRAM INSTRUCTIONS***

COMPILE: 
gcc client.c -o client

RUN:
./client localhost <PORT NUMBER>

RUN example:
./client localhost 8080

The command line arguments are as follows:
argv[1] - localhost
argv[2] - <PORT NUMBER>


***CONSIDERATIONS***
1) The client takes into two types of queries from the user:
   (i) Evaluate <k>
   (ii) Writex <exp> 

There should be a SPACE between EValuate and <K> and also between Writex and <exp> 
Here, K is an integer value and exp is an expression entered by the user.
The value of K starts from 1.

2) The server, once started, keeps on waiting for the same client to reconnect.

3) Expressions such as, X, (X), ((X)), (((X))) are considered the same. Corner (extreme) parenthesis keeps the expression same.

4) Presence or absence of space in between keeps the expressions same.
